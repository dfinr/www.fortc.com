Version 2 of the [Vultr API](https://www.vultr.com/api/) is a major upgrade that brings Vultr into alignment with industry best practices. 

This was my first OpenAPI project. The biggest thing I learned on this project is that Stoplight Studio is the absolute worst editor, except for all the other ones. I wrote most of the YAML with VSCode and used Stoplight to validate it. I'd like to tackle another project like this again, but with a better workflow that includes the Vale linter.
