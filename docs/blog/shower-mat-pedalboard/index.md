It's a happy coincidence that a cheap bamboo shower mat, plus some heavy-duty velcro, is a guitar pedalboard in disguise.

I needed a small pedalboard for the spare bedroom, and the pre-built ones are too big and expensive for what I do. I don't play on stage, and when I drag my equipment to a friend's house, it needs to be as portable as possible.

I was looking at bamboo shower mats one day. Most are natural wood color and grooved for traction, but this one was smooth and painted black. It seemed like a poor design for a bath mat, but it seemed perfect for a guitar pedalboard.

You'll probably find this one if you search for "[Bamboo Bath and Shower Mat(19.7 x 13 inches), Non-Slip](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffcm&q=Bamboo+Bath+and+Shower+Mat(19.7+x+13+inches)%2C+Non-Slip&ia=web)". You might want the next size larger, but I deliberately chose a small one. This project took eight feet of 3M Dual Lock to secure everything, which is excellent stuff. You'll need a pry bar to get the pedals back off, but it's also $2 per foot. If I did this again, I might go with a cheaper velcro. In the end, I saved a few bucks, and the result is better suited to my needs than any pre-built pedalboards I found.

The total cost was $38 and an hour of my time for planning and assembly.
