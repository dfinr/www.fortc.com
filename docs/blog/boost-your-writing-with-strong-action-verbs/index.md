# Boost Your Writing With Strong Action Verbs

The best technical writing is unobtrusive. It doesn't distract the reader from the content. However, excess word clutter and weak verbs can obscure the content and confuse the reader. You can improve your articles by avoiding nouns derived from verbs. Often these are used as direct objects that receive their action from a weaker verb.

> The meme "verb all the nouns" isn't exactly correct. It should be "Revert the Nounifcation of Verbs." 🤷‍♂️

## Examples of Nounified Verbs

Some verbs are converted to nouns by adding suffixes like -ion, -th, and -ment.

| Verb | Noun |
|----|----|
| authenticate | authentication |
| collaborate | collaboration |
| eliminate | elimination |
| grow | growth |
| abandon | abandonment |

Some verbs like *control*, *increase*, and *decrease* can also be nouns without suffixes or changes.

## What's a Direct Object?

Consider the following example:  
> **You can perform the software installation in one step.**

In this sentence, *perform* is the verb acting on the direct object, *installation*. By converting the noun *installation* back to its verb root, you simplify the sentence:  
> **You can install the software in one step.**

## Strong Verbs Made Weak

Some verbs aren't inherently weak, but they become weak when acting on a nounified verb form. Some popular examples are: achieve, bring, cause, create, deliver, do, give, make, obtain, offer, perform, produce, provide, show, and take.

These same verbs are okay when the noun receiving the action is a tangible thing instead of a verb converted to a noun. These strong statements don't need rewriting:

* The bug **caused** the failure.
* The scheduler **performed** the task.
* The script **produced** the CSV file.
* The API **obtained** the data.

## More Examples

These weak sentences were improved by reverting the noun to its base verb form.

| Weaker Construction | Stronger Construction |
| --- | --- |
| Router failure **caused** an **impact** to the customer. | Router failure **impacted** the customer. |
| The module **obtained** the **authentication** for the user. | The module **authenticated** the user. |
| Teams **perform** their **collaboration** on GitHub. | Teams **collaborate** on GitHub. |
| A repeated error **produced** the **growth** of the database. | A repeated error **grew** the database. |
| The scheduled task **performed** the **synchronization** of the server. | The scheduled task **syncronized** the server. |
| Purging old records **produced** a **reduction** in the database size. | Purging old records **reduced** the database size. |

## Summary

When writing documentation or tutorials, have empathy for the reader. They are trying to follow your instructions, and an article cluttered with weak phrases is harder to decipher. So instead, let your technical information shine through using strong verbs and statements.

If following this principle makes your writing stiff and less accessible, feel free to break it. This isn't an absolute rule. However, it's essential to recognize that you are breaking the guideline and doing it deliberately for a particular purpose.

### About This Series

I edit hundreds of articles written by other authors each year. Many of the articles are technically accurate but hard to understand. This series is for technical people who aren't professional writers and want to create better documentation and tutorials.
