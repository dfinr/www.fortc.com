The Yamaha THR-10 is an excellent guitar practice amp. It's portable and runs on either 110v AC or battery power. They are pretty rugged in general, but the power connector is fragile.

Unlike the simple barrel connector you find on most consumer electronics, it has an internal disconnect switch which disconnects the battery pack when the AC power cord is plugged in. 

It took me a couple of months to find the right part, and after much research I discovered that it's a Yamaha V5095000. SMK is the OEM for Yamaha. This part is also known as an SMK LGP7031-0300.

13. _Optional:_ These ams sometimes make a squealing sound if the red lead from the power connector touches the red lead to the aux board. While you have the amp disassembled, you can install a tie-wrap here to keep them separated and prevent that bug.

14. Reassemble the amp and power it up.

It's not a hard repair, and the part is less than $20.
