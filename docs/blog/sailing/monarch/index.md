Gayle and I purchased this boat in 2007 from a charter fleet at the Rolex International Women's Keelboat Championship (RIWKC) in Houston. The boat was stiff and light. I had to add 40+ pounds of lead to bring it up to minimum weight. It also needed new rigging, winches, cleats, and more, so we spent the winter refitting it. We raced it for a few years at local and national events, and the boat was always very quick.
