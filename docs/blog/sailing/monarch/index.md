Gayle and I purchased this boat in 2007 from the charter fleet at the Rolex International Women's Keelboat Championship (RIWKC) in Houston. [Anna Tunnicliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Tunnicliffe) sailed it that weekend under a different sail number and [placed third](https://www.regattanetwork.com/clubmgmt/applet_regatta_results.php?regatta_id=1404). We never placed as well as she did, but we are club racers. Anna is an Olympic gold medalist. 

The boat was stiff and very light; I had to add 40+ pounds of lead to bring it up to minimum weight. But, it needed new rigging, winches, cleats, and more so we spent the winter refitting it. We raced it for a few years at local and national events. A friend designed the logo and we asked a local sign shop to cut the vinyl graphics.

They chartered a different boat in New York. I wasn't able to attend, but we have some photos from the regatta. I'll post those soon.
