## Leukemia Cup Regatta

The Leukemia Cup Regatta in Dallas is a two-weekend event which raised over a million dollars for the Leukemia Society during its 10-year history. The first weekend is a keelboat event at Rush Creek Yacht Club and the second weekend is dingy sailing at White Rock Lake. Here are some photos I took at the 2010 dingy weekend at Corinthian Sailing Club.

Starting line sequence 1 of 7: Notice 5533 has carved out a hole for themselves at the near end of the line.

2 of 7: #5533 continues to drive toward the pin. They appear to be late in this photo, but it's deceptive because they are reaching at full speed while the rest of the fleet is slower.

3 of 7: The gun has been fired. #5533 is still reaching at full speed while the boats at the other end are moving slower, hard on the wind.

5 of 7: It's a promising start for #5533, they have clear air and momentum.

6 of 7: Something goes wrong. #5533 is luffing the main and slowed down.

7 of 7: A good shot of the gap between the aces at the front of the fleet and the rest. The starting line is between the orange flag and the Hoppity Hop.
