!!! Quote "&nbsp;"
    Muphry's Law is the editorial application of the better-known Murphy's Law. Muphry's Law dictates that:  
    
    (a) if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written;  
    (b) if an author thanks you in a book for your editing or proofreading, there will be mistakes in the book;  
    (c) the stronger the sentiment expressed in (a) and (b), the greater the fault;  
    (d) any book devoted to editing or style will be internally inconsistent.
