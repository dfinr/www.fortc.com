# Muphry's Law

![Featured](_media/pexels-karatara-931317.webp)

John Bangsund, in [*Society of Editors Newsletter*](https://web.archive.org/web/20080720221038/http://home.pacific.net.au/~bangsund/muphry.htm) from March 1992 states:

> Muphry's Law is the editorial application of the better-known Murphy's Law. Muphry's Law dictates that:  
> 
>> (a) if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading, there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written;  
>> (b) if an author thanks you in a book for your editing or proofreading, there will be mistakes in the book;  
>> (c) the stronger the sentiment expressed in (a) and (b), the greater the fault;  
>> (d) any book devoted to editing or style will be internally inconsistent.

As I go about the business of blogging about writing, I expect to make inevitable mistakes. It's comforting to know I'm in good company.
