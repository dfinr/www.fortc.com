Many articles that cross my editing desk contain the word **utilize**, when the author really meant **use**. For example, statements like this:

> The server can utilize 16 GB RAM modules.  
> Nginx can utilize SSL/TLS certificates for encryption.  
> Linux will utilize a swap file if it's available. 

_Utilise_ sounds like a fancy version of _use_, but they actually mean different things.

## Use

**Use** can be a noun or a verb.  

* **As a noun**, it means the act of employing or putting into service: *the use of tools.*  
* **As a verb**, it means to employ for some purpose or put into service: *to use a knife.*

## Utilize

**Utilize** is always a verb. Utilize means to use something *beyond its intended purpose*. 

For example, if you are speaking about a knife:

* You *use* the knife to cut a sandwich.
* You *utilize* the knife as a screwdriver.
