Many articles that cross my desk contain the word **utilize**. 

> The server can utilize 16 GB RAM modules.  
> Nginx can utilize SSL/TLS certificates for encryption.  
> Linux will utilize a swap file if it's available. 

It might sound like a formal version, but it's actually not a synonym for use. 

## Use

**Use** can be a noun or a verb.  
As a noun, it means the act of employing or putting into service: *the use of tools.*  
As a verb, it means to employ for some purpose or put into service: *to use a knife.*

## Utilize

**Utilize** is always a verb. Utilize means to use something *beyond its intended purpose*. 

You *use* a knife to cut a sandwich. You *utilize* the knife as a screwdriver. You can *use* a hard drive for file storage or *utilize* it as a paperweight. 

## Summary

If you are describing something performing an action beyond its normal, intended purpose, then the word *utilize* is correct. Otherwise, choose *use*. For example, to restate an example from the first section, we could say:

> The server can use 16 GB RAM modules. The administrator can utilize the old 4 GB modules as fancy earrings for their significant other.
