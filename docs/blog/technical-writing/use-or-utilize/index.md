**Utilise** sounds like a fancy version of **use**, but the words mean different things.

* **Use** means to employ for some purpose or put into service.  
    **_You use a knife to cut a sandwich_**.

* **Utilize** means to use something beyond its intended purpose.  
    **_You utilize a knife as a screwdriver_**.

I edit hundreds of articles each year for Vultr's documentation library, and many authors substitute _utilize_ for _use_. I think it may be a misguided attempt to sound more "professional". But, take heart &mdash; there's no need to fluff up your documentation because _use_ is a perfectly fine word. Here are more examples:

### This is incorrect

* _The webserver can **utilize** 16 GB RAM modules as main system memory._ 

Because the RAM is being employed for its intended purpose, it is being **used**, not **utilized**.

### This is correct

_You can utilize a newspaper as a flyswatter._ 

The newspaper's intended purpose is to publish news, but newspapers are often utilized for many unintended purposes.
