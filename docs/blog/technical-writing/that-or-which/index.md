I use a simple mnemonic device to remember when to use **which** and when to choose **that**. If you want the short answer, [jump to the bottom.](#the-short-answer)

Otherwise, let's go on a journey.

## The Rule

Here is the basic rule I was taught in school:

* **That** should be used with restrictive modifiers – a word, phrase, or clause that **is essential** to the meaning of the sentence.
* **Which** should be used with nonrestrictive modifiers: a word, phrase, or clause – usually separated by commas – which **is not essential** to the meaning of the sentence.

If you like tables, here's another version:

| **Word** | **What Does It Do?**                                  | **Example**                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| which    | Nonrestrictive: adds information                      | The server, **which** needs an upgrade, crashed last night. |
| that     | Restrictive: clarifies what noun you're talking about | The server **that** crashed last night had a disk failure.  |

## In Popular Use

The movie [*Conan the Barbarian*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082198/) opens with a quote by Nietzsche[^1], which, when translated into English, reads:

> That which does not kill us makes us stronger.

The phrase "does not kill us" is restrictive – without it, the sentence becomes meaningless. But, following the rule creates an awkward double-word construction:

> **That that** does not kill us makes us stronger.

## Do we need rules?

The quote demonstrates that there are times when you **absolutely should** break this rule. But, how do we know when breaking the rule is okay? And, who made up this rule anyway? And, going even deeper philosophically, should grammar prescribe the "proper" use or describe how it's used?

Traditionally, I've been a rule follower. However, this book has opened my thinking: *Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language* by [Gretchen McCulloch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739320-because-internet). It's a fascinating dive into how people use language and makes a strong case against overly prescriptive grammar.

After reading her book, I think that *it depends*. We do need rules. Without rules and conventions, technical writing is challenging to decipher. But, the point of technical communication is *communication*, so we must adapt to contemporary usage. Things change, and we must adapt to how people read and learn.

For example, I cringe when I read phrases in documentation like "*head on over to [some URL]*," which I think should be written as, "*navigate to [some URL] in your web browser*." 

## A World of Cursive, Nearly Forgotten

But, if I try to enforce my personal bias, I look like the people who still insist we should teach children cursive handwriting.

And... to imagine a world where only cursive is allowed, take a minute to study this scrawl:

![Henry David Thoreau - Journal - Feb 3rd 1860.png](_media/Henry-David-Thoreau-Journal-Feb-3rd-1860.webp)

I can't decipher that. But, thanks to the scholars at [UC Santa Barbara](https://thoreau.library.ucsb.edu/project_main.html) who decoded it, I can report that it says:

> When I read some of the rules for speaking & writing the English language correctly,– so that a sentence must never end with a particle– & perceive how implicitly even the learned obey it–I think
>
> Any fool can make a rule  
> And every fool will mind it.
>
> – Henry David Thoreau

## Rules and Fools?

So who were the fools that decided the rules for **that** and **which**?

[Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/when-to-use-that-and-which) has a deep dive on this topic.[^2] In the 1600s, they were completely interchangeable, and everyone seemed happy. In 1906, professional nitpickers Henry Watson Fowler and his brother Francis George published a guideline in their textbook, *The King's English*.

> That should never be used to introduce a non-defining clause.
>
>…Which should not be used in defining clauses except when custom, euphony, or convenience is decidedly against the use of that.

Apparently, this didn't get much traction at first. Henry was still complaining that writers were ignoring his rule in a second textbook, which he published 20 years later. 

Today, Merriam-Webster describes modern usage this way:

> We conclude that at the end of the 20th century, the usage of *which* and *that*—at least in prose—has pretty much settled down. You can use either *which* or *that* to introduce a restrictive clause—the grounds for your choice should be stylistic—and *which* to introduce a nonrestrictive clause.

## The Short Answer

This has been an overly-complicated exploration of a simple question, so thanks for reading. 

!!! Note "The short answer"
    If the phrase can be tossed out like a plastic sand**wich** bag, use **which**.


The sandwich is the thing. The plastic bag is just throwaway. It's not essential to the sandwich, because you could have wrapped it in waxed paper.[^3] If your phrase is non-essential like the sandwich bag, use **which**. 

On the other hand, either one is fine for a restrictive phrase. If the sentence loses all meaning when the phrase is removed, then use the word that sounds best, and don't worry about your choice. 

[^1]: It's not a great translation; I think [Kelly Clarkson's](https://youtu.be/Xn676-fLq7I) version is more faithful to the [original German](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-stronger/).
