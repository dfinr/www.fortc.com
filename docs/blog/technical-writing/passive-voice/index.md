This might be the only article you've read about the passive voice that doesn't use [the z-word](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=passive voice "by zombies"). That's a classic tip, but you'll find dozens of other articles that mention those fictional monsters. 

This article explains when you *should* use the passive voice instead of lecturing you about the benefits of the active voice. 

## What is the passive voice?

A sentence written in passive voice usually follows this formula:

**[the thing receiving action] + [a version of verb to be] + [past participle of a verb] + [by the thing doing the action]**

So, for example, something like this:

**[The server] [was] [rebooted] [by the administrator].**

The prepositional phrase at the end is optional. If you left that out, the sentence would become, "The server was rebooted." But, now it's unclear what rebooted the server.

That same statement in active voice is unambiguous: "**The administrator rebooted the server.**" Most style guides, including [the one I wrote](https://www.vultr.com/docs/vultr-docs-style-guide), recommend using active voice most of the time. 

Many English speakers tend to speak in the passive voice habitually. Because I write my first drafts the same way I talk, I usually litter them with passive sentences. When I clean those up I don't blindly change everything to active voice — sometimes I deliberately use passive voice.

## When *should* you use passive voice?

It's a judgment call. In case of doubt, active voice is usually better. But, as you get into the editing habit, you'll find cases when passive voice works better in specific situations. Here are some reasons to consider.

### To shift emphasis

The subject of a sentence carries more weight. When the noun receiving the action is more important than the actor, passive voice is a better choice. 

"*A volcano buried Pompeii*," doesn't have the same impact as the passive version, "**Pompeii was buried by a volcano.**" 

If you want to describe *which database* to purge, it makes sense to say, "**The employee database is purged by the monthly cleanup script.**" However, if you need to explain *what purges* the database, stick to the active voice: "**The monthly cleanup script purges the employee database.**"

### When the actor is unknown

Passive voice may be better if you don't know who or what is acting, or it's not essential to the topic. An article discussing the maintenance of an employee database might say, "**The employee database is purged each month.**" It's straightforward, and unless you are trying to solve a mystery, it's probably best to avoid forcing the awkward active voice construction, "*An unknown process purges the employee database each month.*"

### To avoid assigning blame or to obscure information

Error messages often avoid blaming the user. You've probably seen messages like, "**A phone number wasn't entered**," when filling out a form, and it's a better choice than the active version, "*You didn't enter a phone number*," which sounds a little harsh.

Passive voice is also a popular way to obscure data in an error message. If you want to avoid leaking information to attackers, "**The account was not found**," is more secure than "*SRV27 did not find ACCOUNT_ID in the CUSTOMER table*."

### When the actor is obvious

Sometimes the actor is obvious. If you say, "**The web page is reloaded after five minutes**," it's probably obvious that a web browser will reload the web page. It's straightforward, while the active version, "*The web browser reloads the web page after five minutes,*" is redundant.

### To state a general truth

"**Most passenger cars are designed for paved roads.**" 

There's no need to shoehorn the history of car designers into that sentence. Leaving it as a passive statement is preferred.

## Tips for identifying passive voice

The first step to using the passive voice effectively is to learn how to distinguish between active and passive sentences.

Forms of the verb *"to be"* are integral to passive voice, so search your article for **is**, **am**, **are**, **was**, **were**, **be**, **being**, and **been**, then review those sentences to see if you can improve them. 

Because it's common to omit the prepositional phrase in passive sentences, try finishing them with "…by (plural noun of your choice)." I like to use "**…by Smurfs**", but you could use ferrets, rubber ducks, Minions, or even the [z-word](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=passive voice "by zombies") if it makes you happy. Here are some examples:

> The server has been rebooted. (…by Smurfs.)
>
> The meeting is being rescheduled. (…by Smurfs.)
>
> The transaction was canceled. (…by Smurfs.)

If you can complete a sentence this way, it's written in passive voice. And that's not a necessarily bad thing, as long as you know why you did it. 

As a rule, you should write technical articles in the active voice unless you are deliberately choosing the passive voice for a good reason. Pay attention to your choice of voice, and your articles will be crisp and easy for the readers to understand.
