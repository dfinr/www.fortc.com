### Emphasize your specialization

## What makes a bad resume

* Don't include objective on the resume. Save that for the cover letter.
  * Resume is a history of where you worked. And what you accomplished. 
* A general objective is worthless. It needs to be specific and tangible so the hiring manager can evaluate your fit for the job.
* Make sure you have numbers for everything.

## Examples

* Good: "Written 50,000 words worth of blogs for the software industry to close information gap and drive 1 million views on 16 of 30 blogs."
* Bad: "Currently leading content planning, scheduling, and keyword research while continuing to write blogs and ebooks for end-users and clients."
* Good: Authored two 500+ page software user guides for alarm automation software and created an enterprise-level documentation system that is still in use today.
* Good: Managed the documentation system, creating and designing templates using Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, Snaglt and Help and Manual, contributing to the company website marketing copy, customer service, and external customer training.
  * Mentioned specific tools. For example, I should highlight Mac, windows, and Linux tools.
* Create a story. Use storytelling abilities to make it meaningful
  * What you were wring about?
  * Who were you writing for?
  * What were the goals achieved via the writing work?
  * How did you achieve them?

## Focus

  1. Some jobs demand an area of expertise, where a broad display of knowledge can be negative
