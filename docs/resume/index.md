## Experience

### Vultr &bull; Technical Communications Manager

#### March 2020 - Current

Vultr.com is a cloud infrastructure provider with 25 global locations. Our primary competitors are DigitalOcean and Linode.

The Technical Communications team publishes customer documentation written by a community of [external authors](https://www.vultr.com/docs/vultr-docs-program-guide/) and internal resources. I write approximately 15 percent of this content and oversee the internal staff and external author community that contributes the rest. I'm the author of the [Vultr Style Guide](https://www.vultr.com/docs/vultr-docs-style-guide/) and [Markdown Toolkit](https://github.com/vultr/vultr-mdtk), two key resources that provide guidance to our authors.

* Since joining Vultr, I've written and edited more than 1,100 articles, which doubled the size of the [documentation library](https://www.vultr.com/docs/).
* I'm the primary author of [Vultr's API documentation](https://www.vultr.com/api/).
* I develop proofs-of-concept and [customer examples](https://github.com/vultr/vultr-marketplace) for Vultr's GitHub repository.
* As Vultr is a lean organization, I also function as a part-time developer advocate and [I am advertised on the website](https://www.vultr.com/news/QA-How-One-Customer-Became-A-Developer-Advocate/) in that role. I contribute both [credited](https://www.vultr.com/news/Replication-vs-Backup-Explained/) and [uncredited](https://www.vultr.com/news/Celebrating-Six-Years-of-Vultr-Docs/) articles to the company blog.

These contributions have been key to Vultr's rapid growth by driving search engine traffic to our site and highlighting new products.
